There are some very useful commands to know when using git:

1. git --version
	-displays the current version of git 
2. touch <filename>.<ext>
	-creates a file of name <filename> and type <ext>
	-ex: touch commands.html 
3. git init 
	-initializes the current directory as a git repository
	-we can now use git commands 
4. git config --global user.name '<name>'
	-before you start doing anything, you want to add your name to the git repository 
5. git config --global user.email '<email>'
	-before you start doing anything, you want to add your email to the git repository
6. git add <filename>.<ext>
	-adds file to git repository
7. git add *.<ext>
	-adds all files of type <ext> to the staging area (staging area is essentially where files wait before being committed)
8. git add .
	-adds all files to the staging area 
9. git status 
	-check to see what is in the current staging area 
	-displays files that:
		1. Have been dded to the staging area and are awaiting commit 
		2. Have not yet been added to the staging area 
		3. Are in the staging area and have been modified 
10. git rm --cached <filename>.<ext> 
	-removes file from the staging area
11. git commit 
	-opens up a VIM editor that shows which files are ready to be committed to the master branch, and allows you to type out comments relating to the changes that you have made 
	-hit "i" to go into insert mode, and now you can type 
	-hit "esc" to get out of insert mode 
	-type in ":wq" when not in insert mode/any other modes to save and commit 
	-if you type "git status" now, you will see that the staging area is empty, as all changes have been committed 
12. git commit -m '<comments here>'
	-what this allows you to do is skip the whole editing step when using the normal "git commit"
	-the comments that you want to accompany your commit will be inserted at <comments here> above
	-ex: git commit -m 'Initial Commit'
13. touch .gitignore 
	-creates a file that will allow us to ignore certain files when doing this like "git add ."
	-inside this file you will just type the name of the files you want to ignore (one per line)
	-as you can see, after doing "git add .", the file name which is inside the .gitignore file is not added to the staging area 
	-we can also do this with folders, but instead of adding a file name, you would add "/<folder name>"
14. git branch <branch name>
	-if you want to commit changes for others to see and use, but don't want to overwrite the current master branch because your code might have bugs, git has something known as "branches"
	-this command creates a new branch of name <branch name> 
15. git checkout <branch name>
	-moves you into the <branch name> branch, which allows you to know commit changes, add files, etc to this other branch 
	-you will notice when you change branches that files that you have added in one branch but not to the current one will not be listed in the directory 
	-on top of that, if you have a file with that has new info saved in one branch and committed, but not in the current branch, the new changes you just made in the previous branch will not be there 
	-this is because you're working in a different branch- branches are completely separate from one another 
16. git merge <branch name>
	-while in the master branch, you can merge the master branch with one of the other branches you have created (specified through <branch name>)
17. git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<github repository name>.git 
	-this allows you to link your local repository to a remote repository on github 
	-ex: git remote add origin git remote add origin https://github.com/EIivaras/GitLearning2.git
18. git remote 
	-lists remote repositories 
19. git push -u origin master 
	-pushes all of our local files to the remote repository
20. git push 
	-now that we are linked to the remote repository, we can just use "git push"
21. git pull 
	-pulls all changes from the remote repository onto your local repository
